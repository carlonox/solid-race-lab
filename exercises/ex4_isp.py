Exercise 4 - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

VehicleActions below is a single "fat" interface that forces every
vehicle to implement actions that make no sense for it: a GasCar has no
pedals, a Bicycle has no engine or wings, and neither can fly. Both are
forced to implement fly() (and other irrelevant methods) with an
"I can't do that" stub -- a classic ISP violation.

YOUR TASK:
  1. Replace the one fat `VehicleActions` interface with several small,
     focused ones: `Movable` (move), `Refuelable` (refuel), `Flyable`
     (fly), `Pedalable` (pedal_harder) -- each with exactly ONE abstract
     method.
  2. Make GasCar implement only Movable + Refuelable, and Bicycle only
     Movable + Pedalable. Remove their now-unnecessary
     NotImplementedError stubs entirely.
  3. Add a new `Drone` class that implements Movable + Flyable (move()
     and fly()) -- and nothing else. It should NOT be forced to
     implement refuel() or pedal_harder().

Run it to see the race once Drone exists:
    python -m exercises.ex4_isp
